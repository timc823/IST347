# Module 16: Final Project


## Datasets
In this project, we use the [wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) downloaded from UCI machine learning library. We are interested to know which factor has a positive relationship with the wine quality. Since it is a multi-class dataset, we compare algorithm of KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Neural Networks.

## Project Requirements
In this final project, you are allowed to work with a partner you have chosen. Each team will have 2 members only.

Your task is the following:

1. Find a suitable dataset of interest to you. It can be from a domain of interest to you such as healthcare, e-commerce, transportation, climate, census, education etc. Any domain is fine. [Avoid small datasets <50 instances]

2. State 1 or 2 interesting data mining questions you might have?

3. Based on that you start to go through CRISP-DM process of finding answers to the questions you pose. Remember typical goals in machine learning include classification, prediction, clustering, association rules and/or text mining web scraping.

4. You can choose any of the ML algorithms, ensemble methods and techniques that we have learned in class so far.

5. Present your performance results.

6. Write a short report on the whole project. The report should be no longer than 7 pages, single-spaced, 10-point font, with 1-inch margin on all sides. It must have the following sections:

   * Title
   * Author names and information
   * Introduction
   * Research Questions
   * Dataset description including attributes and citing source
   * Model building - including data preparation, cleaning, ML models, evaluations.
   * Results and Evaluation of your model
   * Findings and Insights
   * References in either APA style or IEEE numbered style.
