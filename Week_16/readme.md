# Module 16: Final Project

In this project, we use the [wine dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) downloaded from UCI machine learning library. We are interested to know which factor has a positive relationship with the wine quality. Since it is a multi-class dataset, we compare algorithm of KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Neural Networks.
