# Module 11: Deep Learning with Neural Networks

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is completely based on artificial neural networks. A neural network tries to mimic the human brain, so deep learning is also a kind of mimicing of human brain. In deep learning, we donâ€™t need to explicitly program everything. The concept of deep learning is not new. It has been around for a couple of years now. But these days its become a hot buzzword because earlier we did not have that much processing power and a lot of data. As in the last 20 years, the processing power increases exponentially, deep learning and machine learning came in the picture.

It is perhaps the most exciting new development in machine learning.

We will learn both the theory and practice side of deep learning.

Some of the main concepts that we will cover includes perceptrons, activation function, feed-forward, back propagation, gradient descent, optimizers and multi-layer deep neural networks.

On the practical side, we will learn how to construct ANN using the TensorFlow and Keras packages.
