## Course Overview:
We live in a world that generates a tremendous amount of data -more than ever before. Machine learning is often used to build predictive models by extracting patterns from large datasets. These models are used in predictive data analytics applications including price predictions, risk assessment, predicting diseases, predicting customer behavior and document classification. How can a machine learn from experience, to become better at a given task? How can we automatically extract knowledge or make sense of massive quantities of data? These are the fundamental questions of machine learning. Machine Learning is proving to be particularly successful in healthcare. Machine learning and data mining algorithms use techniques from statistics, optimization, and computer science to create automated systems which can sift through large volumes of data at high speed to make predictions or decisions without human intervention.This introductory class will help students learn the most important machine learning approaches used in predictive data analytics, covering both theoretical aspects and practical applications. This class will familiarize you with a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning, and prepare you for research or industry application of machine learning techniques.
