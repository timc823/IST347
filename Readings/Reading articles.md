## Critique #3

Go is a Chinese board game that originated over 3000 years ago. Go is considered profoundly complex. AlphaGo, from a team at Google, is the first computer program to defeat a Go world champion and is arguably the strongest Go player in history.

Research the Internet and in your words write (less than 500 words) a brief description about AlphaGo. In particular what type of deep learning did they use?

There is an interesting movie on AplhaGo that you can watch.
