# Module 5: K-Nearest Neighbors Classification 

The KNN algorithm is a robust and versatile classifier that is often used as a benchmark for more complex classifiers such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Despite its simplicity, KNN can outperform more powerful classifiers and is used in a variety of applications such as economic forecasting, data compression and genetics. For example, KNN was leveraged in a 2006 study (Links to an external site.) of functional genomics for the assignment of genes based on their expression profiles.

In this module we continue our exploration of supervised learning and classification. K-Nearest Neighbors is a highly sophisticated instance-based classifier that can be applied to multi-class labels.

We will also see how we can implement this inside Python and Scikit-Learn.
