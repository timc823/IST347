# Module 7: Naive Bayes Method

This is a classification technique based on an assumption of independence between predictors or what’s known as Bayes’ theorem. In simple terms, a [Naive Bayes classifier](https://www.edureka.co/blog/naive-bayes-classifier/) assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.

To build a Bayesian model is simple and particularly functional in case of enormous data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform sophisticated classification methods as well.
