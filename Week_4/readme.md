# Module 4: Logistic Regression Classification Method 
 
In this module we will start working on how machine learning is used to solve classification problems. The target feature is a label or category that we want to predict by classifying based on certain attributes of the data.

Logistic regression is useful when the target feature is dichotomous or binary. Eg.

Spam or Ham

Red or Blue

Benign or Malignant
