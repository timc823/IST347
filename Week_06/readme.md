# Module 6: Decision Tree Classification
 
A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both classification and regression. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making. As the name goes, it uses a tree-like model of decisions.

A decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top.

In this module, we will explore all the relevant concepts in decision tree. We will in particular study how nodes are split based on information gain.

Decision Tree is sometimes difficult to understand. But it is very popular.

We will then also see how we build these models in Python.

In the extra class after our regular class, I will cover cross validation concepts. This is very useful technique to improve performance and can be applied to a variety of ML models.
